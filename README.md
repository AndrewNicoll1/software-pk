Intro

The field of Pharmacokinetics (PK) provides a quantitative basis for describing the delivery of a drug to a patient, the diffusion of that drug through the plasma/body tissue, and the subsequent clearance of the drug from the patient's system. 
This Python library uses simple 2- and 3-compartment pharmacokinetic models.

2-compartment model:
